# Tokii-Version
Tokii is a small desktop companion device built to display live, useful information at a glance. 
Rather than being locked to a single function, Tokii uses a modular app system — each device runs one app at a time, 
and apps can be installed, swapped, or updated over WiFi using a simple web interface.

This repository contains the Tokii App Selector (tokii_otatest.ino.bin), 
which acts as the “root” system for the device. 
From here, users can choose and install different Tokii apps (such as crypto trackers, miner stats, clocks, and more), 
allowing Tokii to evolve over time without reflashing firmware for every change.

Apps are delivered via OTA updates, 
meaning new features and entirely new use-cases can be added long after the device has shipped, 
turning Tokii into a flexible platform rather than a single-purpose gadget.
